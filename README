An example of how to add a textbox using JQuery with nested forms.

Clone the project and look at the list.rb and the views - lists - new and views - lists - edit.

All JQuery is in application.js

This is a super simple example and I left the JQuery code simple so you could see how this works with out all the chaining of methods.

I removed the "destroy" link which is a part of nifty:scaffold.  There is an issue with JQuery and Prototype.  If you look at the application.html.erb
in the layouts folder you will see that I only load the javascripts needed for this example.  Unobtrusive JS.
